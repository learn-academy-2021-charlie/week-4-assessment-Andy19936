# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

1. What is an instance variable in Ruby? How is it different from other variables?

  Your answer: an instance variable in ruby is a variable that stores the key values within a class, instance variables can't be accesed outside the class they live inside of unlike other variables that exist in a more global scope.

  Your answer: Ruby blocks are anonymous functions defined by {} or keyword do to start the function and end to close the function 

  Researched answer: Ruby blocks are blocks of code that are passed to a method



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP is an approach to programming that looks at everything inside programming being within objects. I will look up a bit more context on functional data to get back to you with...

  Researched answer: OOP is a programming paradigm that deals with using objects to represent things you are programming about and using abstarction to extract, implement and change the data they store within them while functional programming is a pardigm of programming that avoids changing state and mutable data and gets output strictly from arguments passed within functions



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: a class is kind of like frame work for an object or a blueprint.. and an object is a specific sort of situation of that class

6. STRETCH: What is `attr_accessor`?

  Your answer: the attr_accessor is an add on to your class to makes all your individual instance variables more easily accessible within your class vs the alternative of having to make methods to access your @'s
